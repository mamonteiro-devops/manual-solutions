## Private IP Address Ranges
    Private networks can use several IP address ranges assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). These reserved IP address ranges are used by millions of private networks around the world. Private networks should utilize the following address ranges:

        Class A- 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
        Class B- 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
        Class C- 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255


## Public Address Ranges
    All addresses outside private IP address ranges are considered public. But all the IP addresses that fall into one of the following predefined public IP address ranges are definitely public IP addresses. Public IP addresses are significantly more common than private IP addresses, and the public IP address ranges are:

        1.0.0.0 - 9.255.255.255
        11.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255
        129.0.0.0 - 169.253.255.255
        169.255.0.0 - 172.15.255.255
        172.32.0.0 - 191.0.1.255
        192.0.3.0 - 192.88.98.255
        192.88.100.0 - 192.167.255.255
        192.169.0.0 - 198.17.255.255
        198.20.0.0 - 223.255.255.255
